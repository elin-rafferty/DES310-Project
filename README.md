# DES310-Project
Our professional DES310 project with a client from Modern Wolf. Our name is Squid Kid Studios and our game is called Operation Exodus.


About:
The game is a top down rogue-like with elements of resource management. The game utilises tilemaps to create a seamless environment. It has a detailed pixelated art style.
Our game consits of an infinite series of runs where you fight enemies and gather resources. Between each run is a hub where you can relax and sort your inventory, storage and buy items/upgrades from the trader shop.

Currently it contains the main hub and two level layouts.


To Play:
Extract Operation Exodus.zip
Double left-click on Operation Exodus.exe. It will then take you to the main menu. 
From here you can click Play or Tutorial to enter the game, or change settings/controls scheme in the Settings menu.
From the main hub, walk over to the vent on the right and press the interact button (E on keyboard, A on controller) to enter a level.
Once 120 seconds have passed, or the boss of that level is defeated, the exit vent will open, allowing you to travel back to the hub.
Here you can spend any gathered resources on gear and upgrades in their dedicated shops.
