# DES310-Project
Our professional DES310 project with a client from Modern Wolf. Our name is Squid Kid Studios and our game is called Operation Exodus.

About:
The game is a top down rogue like with element of survival and resource management. The game utilises tilemaps to create a seamless environment. It will have a detailed pixelated art style.
Our game will consist of three runs which each last a maximum of 5 minutes. Each run is different with one being an indoor map, one being an outdoor map and last being a boss match. Between each run is a hub where you can relax and sort your inventory, storage and buy possibly items from the traders shop.

Currently it contains the main hub and one run.

To Play:
You double left-click on the build which has the the game name and inky (squid) on it. It will then take you to the main menu. 
You should click play when you are ready and you will be launched in the main hub. Here you should collect and equip the weapons of your choice.
Once you are ready you can walk to the vent and press E to get to the first run. It will start abruptly so be prepared! 
You have a timer in top right, a cooldown on right, health on buttom right. Keep an eye on these! You know start shooting the enemies before the time runs out.
You can collect medkits and scraps while adventuring around the map.
Once it is 120 seconds in then you can travel through the vent at the other side of the map pressing E again. This will lead you back to the hub.
