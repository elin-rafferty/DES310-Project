# DES310-Project
Our professional DES310 project with a client from Modern Wolf. Our name is Squid Kid Studios and our game is called Operation Exodus.

About:
The game is a top down rogue like with element of survival and resource management. The game utilises tilemaps to create a seamless environment. It will have a detailed pixelated art style.
Our game will consist of three runs which each last a maximum of 5 minutes. Each run is different with one being an indoor map, one being an outdoor map and last being a boss match. Between each run is a hub where you can relax and sort your inventory, storage and buy possibly items from the traders shop.

Currently it contains the main hub and two level layouts.

To Play:
Extract Operation Exodus.zip
You double left-click on Operation Exodus.exe. It will then take you to the main menu. 
You should click play when you are ready and you will be launched in the main hub. Here you 
can explore the shops and buy useful items to help pass the level.
Once you are ready you can walk to the vent and press E (or X on the controller) to get to the first run.
You have a timer on the right, a weapon cooldown and health on the bottom right. Keep an eye on these!
You can collect medkits, scrap and consumable items while adventuring around the map from the loot crates scattered around the map.
Once 120 seconds have passed the exit vent will open, allowing you to travel back to the hub by 
pressing E (or X on controller) again. Here you can spend any gathered resources on gear and 
upgrades in their dedicated shops.
