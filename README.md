# DES310-Project
Our professional DES310 project with a client from Modern Wolf. Our code name is "One More Run".

The game is a top down rogue like with element of survival and resource management. The game utilises tilemaps to create a seamless environment. It will have a detailed pixelated art style.

Our game consists of three runs which each last a maximum of 5 minutes. Each run is different with one being an indoor map, one being an outdoor map and last being a boss match. Between each run is a hub where you can relax and sort your inventory etc.
